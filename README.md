# HubFurniture E-Commerce

This project is a full-stack e-commerce platform that replicates the functionalities of HubFurniture, an Egyptian furniture company. It includes an admin panel for managing products and orders, a backend API for communication with the database, and a frontend application for seamless customer interaction.

## Applications

1. **Admin Panel**
   - Built using ASP.NET MVC, this application provides administrators with comprehensive control over the e-commerce platform. Admins can perform CRUD operations on products, manage discounts, and confirm customer orders.

2. **Back-end API**
   - Developed using ASP.NET Web API, this application bridges the front end and the database. It offers endpoints for user authentication, listing products with pagination, sorting, and filtering, cart management, and order processing.

3. **Front-end Application (Angular framework)**
   - Built using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Angular framework, this application enables customers to register, log in, browse products, search and filter them, add items to the cart, and place orders seamlessly.
